- [@venusui/docs](https://github.com/rcasachi/venus/tree/main/packages/docs) : Our documentation website/stories
- [@venusui/components](https://github.com/rcasachi/venus/tree/main/packages/components) : A set of React styled components that follow our design tokens

## Install

In order to install VenusUI components, you should run:

```bash
yarn add @venusui/components
```

If you want to get access to VenusUI tokens, you may run:

```bash
yarn add @venusui/tokens
```

## Usage

You should wrap your application with ThemeProvider and use the components normally:

```javascript
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { ThemeProvider } from "@venusui/components";

import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <ThemeProvider>
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
  </StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

### How to switch through themes

You may create a button to change your theme:

```javascript
const ThemeToggleButton = () => {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Consumer>
      {(context: any) => (
        <Button onClick={context.cycleToggleMode}>
          Mode: {context.colorMode}
        </Button>
      )}
    </ThemeContext.Consumer>
  );
};
```
