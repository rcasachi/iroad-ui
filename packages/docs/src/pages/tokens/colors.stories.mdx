# Colors

Color tokens help guide the user through a consistent, scalable and semantic interface according to their context.

When working with colors, it is extremely important to pay attention to accessibility in the interface. The critical points at this moment are taking care of the contrast of the interactive elements and not using color as the only means of differentiating the objects.
